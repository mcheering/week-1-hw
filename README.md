# week-1-hw
This is the repository for the static website homework for week 1 of program.  You can access site here: https://mcheering.github.io/week-1-hw/

The site should look like the image below, but depending on the size of your browser window or device, sizes may vary. 
<img src="week-1-hw/Screen Shot .png">

index.html contains the text that will be displayed on the static web page. 

assets folder contains the .css stylesheet and the images used on the web page.  

Within the html, a fix was made to the id on the first link in the header so it would take you to the section it specifies.  I also added alt text to improve accessibility.  In addition to the alt text, a title characteristics was added to each image tag in order to provide text when you place your cursor over an image and hold it a for a few seconds.  This text is the same as what's in the alt characteristics of each image teg in the HTML file.
